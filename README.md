🚀 CrowdSense Campus

CrowdSense Campus is a web-based application that helps students check live campus facility status  and view all college events in one place .

The project aims to reduce overcrowding, save time, and avoid missing out on events due to scattered information across different platforms.

❓ Why This Project?

In our college:

Students don’t know if the library or study rooms are crowded 

Facilities may be closed, but students find out only after reaching 

Events are shared across multiple WhatsApp groups and club websites 

There is no single platform to view everything
